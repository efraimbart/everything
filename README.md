[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)


Everything is a middleware solution designed to simplify the process of connecting and aggregating APIs that adhere to the Everything API guidelines. By utilizing Everything, applications can interact with multiple APIs through a single unified interface. Think of it as a way to bring together various services and platforms, enabling seamless integration for developers and users alike.

## How it Works

Let's say you have an app that needs to connect with different services that implement the Everything API. For instance, let's consider a service called Example at `https://example.z.gripe`. With Everything, you can navigate to a specific URL, such as `https://everything.gripe/user/example.z.gripe:everything`. This URL will then redirect or proxy you to `https://example.z.gripe/user/everything`, effectively establishing a connection between your app and the desired API.

The benefit of using Everything is that you can consolidate multiple APIs under a single URL, allowing users to authenticate themselves or make requests to different services from one central location.

## Features

- **API Aggregation:** Everything acts as a central hub for accessing various APIs that adhere to the Everything API guidelines.
- **Simplified Integration:** Instead of implementing multiple APIs individually, developers can integrate with Everything, reducing complexity and saving time.
- **Unified Requests:** By utilizing Everything, apps can make requests to multiple services using a consistent and unified interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with Everything, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Everything repository: `git clone https://github.com/everything-gripe/everything.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Access Everything through the provided URL, e.g., `http://localhost:3000`

### Making Requests with Everything

To make requests to integrated APIs through Everything, follow these steps:

1. Determine the API endpoint you want to access through Everything.
2. Construct the request URL using the Everything URL format, e.g., `http://localhost:3000/user/example.z.gripe:efraimbart`.
3. Make a request to the constructed URL, and Everything will redirect or proxy the request to the corresponding integrated API.
4. Handle the response returned by Everything or the integrated API accordingly in your application.
